# Specifications for extra functionality to add

--jquery
[] watched checkmark videos, index
[] button: mark video watched
[] button: delete view status 




previous rating system:
- can probably remove notes from it
- should users be allowed to rate videos more than once?


Future:
- grab pause time stamps/or current time stamp and add to a note for reference.
- clicking a note, starts the video a few seconds before the given time stamp.
- jquery buttons for admins to edit/delete in video show page?
- jquery buttons for regular users to add a video rating
- jquery add a section
- jquery add a video

FINAL REFACTOR:
[] refactor controllers to use respond to and json
-- rating system 
[] remove notes
[] keep or replace for a rating gem?
